Service virtualization is a relatively new concept, invented by ITKO (since acquired by CA Technologies) in 2007. 
The term itself is defined as the act of creating a behavioral model of an application interface for the purpose of more efficient software development. 
By emulating the behavior of a system (versus creating a copy of record), developers can modify complex applications at greatly reduced costs.
